But unfortunately you are going to have to wait till the end. Until we get there‚Ä¶ I coded this project up for you because I just wanted to take you on a journey through some songs. Talk a little about them and create a beautiful story. I wanted to start with Slow Motion because it was the song that you put me on very very very early on. When we first met. I don't know if it was from a story or reel, but all I knew is that I loved this song because you did. Just like the flowers in the pic! It was also the very first set of flowers I gave you. Aka the start of everything. Hope you enjoy and onto the next song!!!"

I knew from that that you weren't some girl that I met, you were someone I saw forever with ever since that first date (which is what the pic is in case you forgot). Probably my favorite date I have ever been in. With those fuck ass gigantic ass big booty ass drinks. Everything was hectic but with you everything seemed so calm and amazing.

I was like fuckkkkk, pointed a gun to my jaw, Loaded up the gun, and realized that it's okay cuz I'm bound to see her again the day after your grad lol. Kali Uchis is right there next to Tyler in favorite artists. And this song shows exactly why, cuz she's an amazing singer and it reminds me of an amazing post on your insta. And finally, we reached the very end of this short playlist. As you saw, I just wanted to show you the different songs that remind me of you, the different times that connect me to those songs, and take you on a journey one more time. I am ready to love on you Tanya. and I'm ready to do it loud and proud. With nuclear bombs (fireworks) exploding all around us as Kali Uchis plays in the background (or in our heads). Anyways, before you ended things, I bought something. which comes from the question that I was going to ask in the very beginning of this playlist. And it's if you would like to go to the Kali Uchis concert with me on September 11th, 2025 @ 8:00PM. I wanted to surprise you with these but it didn't end up working. So, if you want to, I would like to at least not let these tickets go to waste and go with you. I know all you wanted is someone to love you hard and loud. And it is fair that it isn't much to ask. So, this is my attempt in doing that. I have more plans on what to do in person with you. But. Do to the circumstances right now, this is the only thing I could think of on doing for you right now. Creating a mini playlist and tell you all the reasons why you are amazing to me. Took me many days. And hours of debugging. Especially connecting to the fuck ass Spotify API. But after 1000+ lines of code later, it seems like it ended up working in the end. And I hope to GOD it is not buggy on your computer. Anyways. you have my number. Or if you deleted it it's (631)805-7596. Hope to hear from you soon. And if I don't then it is okay! I got my answer from that. Anyways, ALL I CAN SAY (get it) is I hope you enjoyed the journey I took you in. Have a good day/night/whenever I gain the courage to send this. You will forever be in my heart Tanya."
